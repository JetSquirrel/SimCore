"""Correctness comparison: are simu and SimPy indistinguishable?

Both tools now draw from the *same* portable feed (SplitMix64 + shared
transforms — see `compare/models/_feed.py` and `src/rng.rs`), seeded identically
per replication. So for the order-insensitive models the comparison runs in
**exact mode**: seed-by-seed, every metric must agree to a tight relative
tolerance (`--exact-tol`, default 1e-9). The only residual is floating-point
summation order, which lands ~1e-15.

One model is *not* exact-eligible and stays on the distributional test:

  * `hospital` — the `early_discharged` metric is sensitive to simultaneous-event
    tie-breaking during the eviction handoff, which legitimately differs between
    the engines' execution models (see `compare/README.md`). It is an *engine*
    ordering difference, not an RNG one, so a shared feed cannot remove it.

For distributional (non-exact) models a metric FAILS only when the difference is
both **statistically significant** (Welch's t-test p < alpha) **and material**
(relative mean difference > tol) — the "significant AND material" gate avoids the
large-sample trap where a negligible difference becomes significant purely
because R is large.
