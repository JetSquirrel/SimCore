//! Shared waiter bookkeeping for the unit-pool resources.
//!
//! `Resource`, `PriorityResource` (and the post-MVP `PreemptiveResource`) all
//! follow the same **direct-handoff** protocol: a request takes a free unit
//! immediately if one is available, otherwise it parks a waker in an ordered
//! queue; releasing a unit *transfers* it to the next live waiter (setting the
//! waiter's `granted` flag and waking it) without the unit ever becoming
//! observably free — see [`WaitQueue::release`]. The only thing that differs
//! between the resource types is the *order* in which parked waiters are served.
//!
//! [`WaitQueue`] captures that protocol once. Waiters are served in ascending
//! `(key, seq)` order — smallest key first, ties broken FIFO by an internal
//! monotonic sequence. FIFO scheduling is therefore just the degenerate case
//! `K = ()` (every key equal → pure insertion order); priority scheduling uses
//! `K = u32` (lower number = higher priority).
//!
//! Extracting this here keeps the `registered` / `canceled` / `granted` /
//! drop-cancel invariants (see `SPEC.md §4.7`) in a single place rather than
//! copied across every resource type.
